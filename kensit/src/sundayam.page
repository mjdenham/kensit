We meet at Kensit Evangelical Church at 11.00 a.m. for our morning service.
The focus of the meeting is to hear God speak to us as the Bible is preached.

The congregation is a mix of singles, families and older people.

*	The service lasts until about 12.15 pm.  
*	A children's talk is usually included.
*	A creche for children six years old and under is available during the preaching part of the service. Members of the Church Family are happy to look after the children, although parents can be there if they wish. There is an audio link to the main meeting.
*	[How to get here][location].
