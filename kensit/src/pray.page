Prayer permeates all we do, but there are times in the week when members of the Church Family meet especially to pray.

Our Bible Study and Prayer Meeting is held on Thursday evenings. The meeting starts with a study from the Bible and then we  
fellowship in prayer, seeking God in this vital means of grace. 
This meeting is held at the church, starting at 8.00 p.m. and finishes at 9.30 p.m.
 
Once a month the evening will focus on Christian service overseas.
