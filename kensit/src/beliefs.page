Although we have no desire to impose a human creed upon another person's conscience, it is right and necessary 
as a professing Christian church to set out a statement of those truths which we believe to be fundamental to 
the Christian Faith, which we confess in our worship, and upon which we are glad to have fellowship with 
other churches and to receive as brothers and sisters those who desire to enter into membership with us.

*	We believe in the inerrancy of the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as originally given, their verbal inspiration from God and their supreme authority as the only rule of faith and practice.
*	We believe in One God in three Persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
*	We believe in the sovereignty of God in creation, providence, redemption and judgement.
*	We believe in the essential, absolute and eternal Deity of our Lord Jesus Christ; his conception by the Holy Spirit; his birth of the virgin Mary; his real but sinless humanity; the authority and infallibility of all his teaching; his voluntary humiliation in life as a Man of Sorrows culminating in his substitutionary death and a propitiatory sacrifice for sin; his resurrection from the dead on the third day in that very body that had lain in the tomb; his ascension into heaven as the only and eternal mediator between God and man, interceding for his people at the right hand of the Father, and his personal return in power and glory.
*	We believe in the personality and Deity of the Holy Spirit through whom alone the soul is born again to saving repentance and faith and by whom the saints are sanctified through the truth; and in the need of his presence and power in the worship and witness of the church.
*	We believe in man's utter ruin and slavery to sin and Satan as a result of the Fall and his salvation solely by grace through faith in Jesus Christ whose righteousness imputed to him is the only ground of acceptance before God.
*	We believe in the resurrection of the body, the judgement of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ, the everlasting blessedness of the saved in the glory of the new creation and the everlasting punishment of the lost in the horrors of hell.
*	We believe that Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church and that this great universal body of believers is to be seen locally where the Word of God is faithfully preached, the sacraments are duly administered, discipline rightly exercised and practical love and concern shown to those in need.
*	We believe that there are only two sacraments, Baptism and the Lord's Supper to be administered in the church and that worship is due to God alone and must be in spirit and in truth.
