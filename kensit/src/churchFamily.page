Kensit Evangelical Church welcomes a broad mix of people, young and old, single and married, from all nations and 
backgrounds. Our aim is that everyone who comes to Kensit will hear the message of the Bible clearly taught.

###Leadership

We are led by our pastor <a href="pastor.html">Revd. Spencer Cunnah</a> and our two elders, David Bond and Brian Stevens.

###Church Family Members

Many people decide to make Kensit their long-term 'home'. Some will be workers; some will be mothers or home-makers; 
some will be retired; some will be students or even still at school; some won't fit easily into any category! 
Together we are a Church Family because we want to express our commitment to one another as a result of our 
commitment to Jesus Christ.

Most of the Church Family attend the [Sunday Morning](sundayam.html) Service. This begins with all ages meeting together. 
Parents with children six years old and under are welcome to use our cr&eacute;che for the preaching part of the service. 
This includes an audio link to the main meeting. Many of the Church Family will also be present for the 
[Sunday Evening](sundaypm.html) Service, as well as the Thursday evening [Prayer and Bible Study](pray.html).

Children of those inside and outside the Church Family are welcome at our [Friday Club](children.html). 
[Parents and toddlers](women.html) and [Ladies](women.html) have their own gatherings. Anyone wanting to know more about Christianity 
is welcome at one of our [Christianity Explored](ce.html) classes and, of course, our other [meetings](meetings.html) too.
