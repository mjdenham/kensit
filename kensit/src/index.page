### Welcome to Kensit Evangelical Church!  

**We are** a gathering of Christians of all ages and many nationalities meeting in the Finchley area of North London.

**Our aim** is to bring glory to God by living for Jesus Christ and making him known. 
In our meetings we seek to explain the Bible clearly so that people can understand it and respond to its message.

**We welcome** people at any stage of Christian understanding and especially want to help those who want to investigate Christianity.

<a href="pastor.html">Revd. Spencer Cunnah</a> is the Pastor.
