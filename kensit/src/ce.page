We run Christianity Explored classes for any enquirers when they are required. Participants are not asked to pray, 
sing or read aloud, but they can ask questions - any question they like. If you would like to attend a class 
then you may ask a church leader directly after a Sunday meeting or e-mail 
the [Church Secretary](mailto:secretary@kensit.org.uk) for details.

What makes the Christian gospel distinctive is its insistence on God's remarkable grace: the clear teaching that although we human beings 
are rotten to the core, we are loved. Loved with an outrageous, daring, incomprehensible love, and what's more, 
loved by the very person whose love we have treated as if it were unworthy of us.
