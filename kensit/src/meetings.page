Our main focus is on the Sunday services of worship, which are open to all, but there are also
other weekly activities when various groups meet together.  From time to time we hold Guest Evenings
when neighbours and friends of the church can meet with us socially for a meal, entertainment,
discussion or to listen to a christian speaker.
