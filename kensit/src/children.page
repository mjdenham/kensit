Our two youth meetings on Friday are the main focus of our activities for children, providing a good opportunity 
for Bible teaching as well as fun and games. The children meet at the church in two groups:

- 6:00pm - 7:00pm: Explorers (for 5 - 11 year olds)
- 7:30pm - 9:00pm: Matrix (for 12 year olds and above)

Games nights, quizzes, trips and similar activities form an important part of the programme.

In the summer a "Holiday Activity Week" is held for the children of the area.
