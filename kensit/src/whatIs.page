What is God like? Who is Jesus? Why did he come? What does he demand of those that follow him?

At Kensit Evangelical Church we run [Christianity Explored](ce.html) classes as required for anyone with questions similar to these. Meeting in an informal setting, guests can ask any question they like. Relaxed discussion and open exploration of the basics of Christianity is facilitated by these classes.

Our Sunday [morning](sundayam.html) and [evening](sundaypm.html) services take place at 11.00 a.m. and 6.30 p.m. respectively. These are good opportunities to meet with Christians and learn more about what we believe.

Visit the [Two Ways to Live](http://www.matthiasmedia.com.au/2wtl) website which outlines the main points of the Christian message and the choice that we all face in a series of easy-to-understand pages.
