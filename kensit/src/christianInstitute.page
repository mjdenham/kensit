Thursday 12 February 2015  
8.00pm - 9.30pm

###Religious Liberty
The recent 'British values' school standards are being used to undermine Christian parents and teachers in schools across the country.
Proposals for new 'Extremist Disruption Orders' also threaten gospel freedom.

###Christian Citizenship
We will give biblical and practical advice on how to get involved through prayer and action, e.g. writing letters or contacting the media.
We will also discuss issues of concern likely to arise in the upcoming General Election.

###Sanctity of Life
The Bible upholds the sanctity of every human life regardless of how young, old, able-bodied or disabled that life might be.
Yet the practice of abortion is widespread in Britain and there are calls for assisted suicide to be legalised.
We will bring you the latest developments.
