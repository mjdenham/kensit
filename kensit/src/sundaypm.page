We meet at Kensit Evangelical Church at 6:30 pm for our evening service.
The focus of the meeting is to hear God speak to us as the Bible is preached.

The congregation tends to be a mix of singles, couples and older people, although a few children are sometimes present.

*	The service lasts until about 7.40 pm.
*	Lord's Supper (Communion) is held after this service, normally on the second and last Sundays of each month.
*	Light refreshments provide an opportunity for conversation, welcoming visitors and getting to know each other at the end of the evening.
*	[How to get here][location].
